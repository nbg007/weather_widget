# weather widget

To run:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```


Note:
1, In the requirement, it says: 
```
The widget editor must also display a list of already created widgets with their title and a snippet of code that allows that widget to be embedded.
```
sorry, I don't really understand this. In my understanding, Editor is only used to edit a existing widget, not create a new widget. Besides, there is no "CREATE" button and no design for this, so I don't know how to repsent it and skip this part



2, In the initial running, it may ask you to allow the browser to use your location, please click "Allow"
